# Shi Jun Wee

Hi! My name is Shi Jun (he/him). I am from Singapore, and will be heading to Maryland, USA, for my PhD in Fall 2023. My interests are in using satellite remote sensing to investigate the trends, drivers, and impacts of land-cover/land-use change and its interactions with climate change, with a focus on tropical regions. I will be working in the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) laboratory, under the supervision or Dr. Xiao-Peng Song.
